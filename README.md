# Pinball Score Camwheels

## Overview

The score camwheels in some vintage pins may crack or otherwise become too worn to work properly due to their age and use. While there [are workarounds][pinrepair motor] to correct certain types of damage nobody is offering replacement cams at the time of writing. This repository aims to provide 3D models of these cams so anyone with access to a 3D printer can repair their machines.

:exclamation: Disclaimer: While I have done my best to determine the correct dimensions from videos, pictures, and prior works (see [Special Thanks](#special-thanks), I do not currently own any cams to compare against. As a result, I strongly recommend printing these models in a cheap material first to ensure they work. If you do print a model and find it's not working right, please do not hesitate to [let me know][report an issue] so the file can be corrected.

Missing a model you need? Something not working right? If so, just [report an issue] and and I'll be happy to take a look.

## Special Thanks

I'd like to thank [Deverezieaux] at the Vintage Arcade Preservation Society (VAPS) and at Pinside and [cerebral3d] ([ArtStation][cerebral3d artstation] & [Twitch][cerebral3d twitch]) for sharing their own 3D modeled cam with me to reference and providing pictures of their setup and guidance. Without their help it would have taken much longer to produce useable cams.
